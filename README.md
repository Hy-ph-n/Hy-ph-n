## About Me

<img align='right' src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Hy-ph-n&show_icons=true&theme=vision-friendly-dark">

I am a college student majoring in computer science with a particular focus upon learning new programming languages and expanding my skills in languages I know. I am interested in technology as a career, and want to spend time becoming more experienced as a programmer. I'm currently learning how to properly document Java programs, as well as when it is appropriate to use threads. In addition to programming languages I know, I am familiar with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans, SQLite, MySQL, and have even wrote various little programs or program lines in Notepad++.
